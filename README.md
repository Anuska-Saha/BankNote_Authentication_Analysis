# BankNote_Authentication_Analysis
Although the incidence of counterfeiting is relatively low,  there are still some counterfeit banknotes in circulation and has become a serious threat to our society. With the  advancement in digital image processing, it also plays a  significant role in producing increasing number of fake  banknotes every year [1]. But the main problem is how to  identify and classify that the banknotes are real or  counterfeit? In this research, the author not only focuses on  detecting the real or counterfeit banknotes, but to also how  classify between real or counterfeit banknotes. Nowadays, automatic machines which accept banknotes are  developed to meet various needs and functions. These  machines recognize banknotes fed to them by identifying the  design or value of the banknotes. It is extremely important  for such machines to authenticate the banknote to distinguish it between real and counterfeit notes. In general,  authentication is more difficult than recognition, since the  differences in designs or values are deliberately designed to  be readily distinguished, while forgeries are deliberately  created for intended purposes to be indistinguishable from  genuine banknotes.
